        <div class="bio">
              E. Joseph Steier (Joe) Steier, III is president, CEO and
              co-founder of Signature HealthCARE (SHC), one of the nation’s
              leading long-term care, rehabilitation and health care providers
              with 125 locations in 11 states and some 18,000 employees. SHC’s
              mission and vision is to “radically change long-term care forever"
              through its three foundational pillars – Spirituality, Learning
              and Intra-preneurship. Under Steier’s leadership, SHC has earned
              many national accolades and helped catapult the city of Louisville
              into the national spotlight as a leader in innovation in aging
              care. The company also continues to advance clinical programming
              and has achieved its best regulatory performance levels to date
              with nearly 50% of centers earning 4- and 5-star ratings from the
              Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

              Prior to SHC, Steier founded Professional Healthcare Services,
              a specialized strategic planning and reimbursement consulting
              firm, and helped build Home Quality Management (HQM) from a small,
              family-owned nursing home chain to a top 20 regional chain focused
              on quality of life. Steier was president and COO until HQM was
              sold in 2007. He is also cofounder of the Louisville Innovation
              Summit to convene national leaders in health care, technology,
              design and other fields, and spark dialogue about the future of
              aging care.

              A Louisville native, Steier has two decades of professional
              experience invested in health care.
